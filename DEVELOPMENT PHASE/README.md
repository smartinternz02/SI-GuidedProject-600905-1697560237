## Project Development Phase

Welcome to the development phase of the Potato Classification Project. In this phase, we will focus on building and implementing the Potato classification system based on the planning details outlined in the planning phase.

### Table of Contents
### Project Manual

The Project Manual serves as a foundational document for the Potato Disease Classification Project, offering clear objectives, methodologies, and best practices. It establishes roles and responsibilities, ensuring a systematic approach and fostering a shared vision for the successful development of a potato disease classification system.

The manual consists of the following sections:

Data Preparation for Potato Disease Classification
- Provides guidance on acquiring the dataset and organizing potato disease images, which is essential for data preparation.
 
Data Pre-processing for Potato Disease Classification

- Explains how to import and configure the ImageDataGenerator library to effectively process the data, both for training and testing datasets.

Model Construction for Potato Disease Classification

- Offers detailed instructions for creating, compiling, and training a pre-trained model tailored for potato disease classification. This section also covers the monitoring of validation loss and testing the model with custom inputs.

Building a Flask Application for Potato Disease Classification

- Details the process of developing a Flask-based web application and creating an HTML page to deploy the potato disease classification model, ensuring practical usability and accessibility.
